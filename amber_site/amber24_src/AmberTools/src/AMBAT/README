 AMBAT stands for Amber Membrane Builder and Analysis Tool

 This software is distributed as two separate scripts and one separate 
 protein insertion script (present in the folder 'source_code'):

    AMBAT_MB.tcl : Membrane Builder
    AMBAT_AT.tcl : Analysis Tool
    AMBAR_PI.tcl : Protein insertion code

To install:
   - Install the standard tcl shell (tested with tclsh version 8.5/8.6) 
     (should be available from the standard linux repositories like yum)

   - Install tcl math library for mathematical operations: get the
     Tcllib-1.16 library from https://www.tcl.tk/software/tcllib/;
     un-tar it; in the untar directory run 'tclsh installer.tcl'

The "intructions" folder gives a detailed pictorical representation for 
   running the software.

A manuscript for AMBAT is currently in the latter stages of preparation.
