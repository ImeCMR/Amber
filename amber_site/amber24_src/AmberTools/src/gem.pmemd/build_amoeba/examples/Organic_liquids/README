THE INITIAL INGREDIENTS FOR THE 3 SIMULATIONS WERE 

benzbox.dyn benzbox.key benzbox.xyz
formbox.dyn formbox.key formbox.xyz
meohbox.dyn meohbox.key meohbox.xyz

TO CONVERT TO prmtop AND inpcrd files, amoeba_parm NEEDS

benzbox.pdb and benzbox.analout
formbox.pdb and formbox.analout
meohbox.pdb and meohbox.analout

NOTE that the key files refer to the param file amoeba.prm which comes with 
TINKER (amoebapro.prm is for proteins and water)

THE benzbox.analout FILE WAS PRODUCED ON MY MACHINE BY THE COMMAND 
~/Tinker4/Tinker4.3/bin/analyze benzbox PC > benzbox.analout
[note that versions before 4.3 will not give enough info in analout file]

THE benzbox.pdb file WAS PRODUCED BY THE COMMAND
~/Tinker4/Tinker4.3/bin/xyzpdb benzbox
i edited the pdb file to change residue names to BEN
the pdb file is necessary in order to get atom and residue names
into the prmtop file

THE benzbox.parmtop and benzbox.inpcrd files WERE PRODUCED ON MY
MACHINE BY THE COMMAND
~/AMBER/amber9/g95/src/build_amoeba/amoeba_parm -name benzbox 
-title "benzene box" > benzbox.amoeba_parm.out

FINALLY the sander run was typical
~/AMBER/amber9/g95/src/sander/sander -i benzbox.mdin -c benzbox.inpcrd 
-p benzbox.prmtop -o benzbox.mdout -r benzbox.restrt

|About the benzbox.mdin:|
|-----------------------|

&cntrl and &ewald have no new variables
---note that the box size is about 1.2x bigger than the usual 1 angstrom grid
for charges and that spline order is 5 (needs to be at least 5 since 3 derivs
are necessary---so far 5 seems ok)

&amoeba contains the key variable  do_amoeba which controls whether the
amoeba code is executed---also a bunch of other flags mainly for debugging

note do_vdw_longrange and do_vdw_taper: the latter gives a polynomial switch
for vdw--this is used by tinker--do_vdw_longrange turns on a long range
continuum correction---not currently in tinker

dipole_scf_tol sets the tolerance (in debye) for successive dipole iterates
  in the SCF. 
dipole_scf_iter_max says when to give up on convergence
sor_coefficient controls the successive over relaxation in the SCF

ee_damped_cut  is the distance at which the Thole' damping turns ON
ee_dsum_cut is the direct sum ewald interaction cutoff 
[note ee_dsum_cut must be less than or equal to cut which serves as vdw cutoff 
as well as setting up the list cutoff--which is why ee_dsum_cut must be <= cut]
