Converting the Amber "jac" benchmark to work with the Amoeba force field.

(1) The jac.amberFF.inpcrd and jac.amberFF.prmtop are copies from the benchmark
of jac. jac.pdb  is produced from these via ambpdb.  Note that histidines 
are given as HID since tinker cares about HID versus HIE or HIS in terms of
number of hydrogens--so its best to be explicit--i.e. defaults mnay not agree
with amber  (similar comments about CYS,CYX)

The jac.key file is basically that from the bench/bench7.key file in the
Tinker 6.2.01 distribution.  Note that the location of the parameters will
need to modfied for your machine.

(2)  Using Tinker 6.2.01, I can create the need Amber files by these commands:
[Note: you will need a tinker "jac.key" file to specify parameters and some
options.]

TINKER_HOME=/home/case/mm/tinker     #  modify for your machine
$TINKER_HOME/bin/pdbxyz jac
$TINKER_HOME/bin/analyze jac PC > jac.analout
tinker_to_amber -name jac -title " jac benchmark "

(3) The Run.amoeba_jac.pmemd script can now be used to run a short MD
simulation.  Note that the system here is equivalent to the "bench7" Tinker
benchmark, but the starting coordinates are not the same.  Therefore, one
could use either jac.inpcrd (starting coords from the Amber benchmark) or
bench7.inpcrd (starting coords from the Tinker benchmark).  The latter ones
make it easier to compare with the Tinker outputs.

(4) From the restrt of the above simulation one can produce a tinker .dyn file:

new_crd_to_dyn
 new_format inpcrd file? (must exist) :
restrt
| New format PARM file being parsed.
| Version =    1.000 Date = 12/20/05 Time = 18:15:40
 Tinker dyn file? (will create) :
jac.dyn

This can be used to help make detailed comparisons between Amber and Tinker.
