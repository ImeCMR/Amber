The builds:

Use the following scripts to build the indicated version of gem.pmemd:

build_ser.gnu - builds serial pmemd.gem using gfortran/gcc.

build_par.gnu - builds parallel pmemd.gem.MPI using gfortran/gcc; assumes that
                MPICH2 Rel 1.5 has been installed under $AMBERHOME per
                Amber install scripts.

build_ser.int - builds serial pmemd.gem using intel compilers, with
                full optimization.  Assumes installation of intel s/w.

build_par.int - builds parallel pmemd.gem.MPI using intel compiler and intel
                MPI. Assumes installation of intel s/w with intel mpi* scripts
                in path.

All builds leave the pmemd.gem or pmemd.gem.MPI executable under
$AMBERHOME/bin.
