About this example

This is a simple example of the Lagrangian Multiplier (LM) constraint method 
(iconstr > 0), which prohibits the rotation of defined 2-center internal 
coordinates. The system is bulk TIP3P water (25 angstroms, octahedral 
PBC). Included files are the following, 

corr.png,	the result of LM constraints
disang.rst, 	the NMR restraint definition file
md5restrt, 	inpcrd file
mdin, 		sander mdin
mdinfo, 	sander mdinfo
oct25.top, 	prmtop file
restrt, 	sander restart file after 10 ps of applying constraint
mdout,  	sander mdout (10 ps)

In disang.rst, atoms 48 and 19 are used to define the internal coordinate, which 
was constrained throughout the MD simulation. The self correlation of this 
internal coordinate can be calculated with ptraj or in VMD. An example of the 
self correlation plot of constrained and unconstrained internal coordinates can 
be found in corr.png. The internal coordinates can be defined using the mass 
centers of two groups. An example is included as well (see gcorr.png). The 
trajectory of the 10 ps constrained MD is not included due to the large file 
size.
